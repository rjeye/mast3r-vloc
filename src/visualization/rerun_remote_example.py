üöÄ Ensure you're running the Rerun Viewer and the Rerun TCP server before running this script.
This can be done by running the following command in a separate terminal on your remote machine:
        rerun --serve
üíª Set up port forwarding by running the following command on your local machine:
        ssh -L 9876:localhost:9876 -L 9877:localhost:9877 -L 9090:localhost:9090 -N user@remote_server
üåê Once the ports are forwarded, open the following URL in your browser to access the web viewer:
        http://localhost:9090?url=ws://localhost:9877
